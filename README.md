Front-end developer stuff:

 * CSS
 * HML
 * Js

And here's some code! :+1:

## HML = Hypster Markup Language



```html
<d>
	divitus is <s class="strong">bad<s>
</d>
```

```css
.class {
	color: #f00;
}
```

```javascript
	var messg = "annoying!";
	console.log(messg);
```

This is [on GitHub](https://github.com/jbt/markdown-editor) so let me know if I've b0rked it somewhere.


Props to Mr. Doob and his [code editor](http://mrdoob.com/projects/code-editor/), from which
the inspiration to this, and some handy implementation hints, came.
